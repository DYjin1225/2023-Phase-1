# MSA NZ 2023 Phase 1

Welcome to Phase 1 of the 2023 MSA programme! This year, the programme is split into two streams (Software Development and Data Science), and Phase 1 consists of a series of Microsoft Learn modules and activities for each stream.

The expected workload for Phase 1 of each stream is 3-4 hours/week. As such, we recommend that you use the content schedule below to spread out your workload and not try to complete everything in one week.

Phase 2 will build upon the content for each stream with a technical project, and summer placements will be either in Software Development or Data Science. As such, we recommend that you follow one stream only in order to manage your time effectively and build your knowledge and skills within one stream as much as you can.
