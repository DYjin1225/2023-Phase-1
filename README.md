# MSA NZ 2023 Phase 1

Welcome to Phase 1 of the 2023 MSA programme! This year, the programme is split into two streams (Software Development and Data Science), and Phase 1 consists of a series of Microsoft Learn modules and activities for each stream.

The expected workload for Phase 1 of each stream is 3-4 hours/week. As such, we recommend that you use the content schedule below to spread out your workload and not try to complete everything in one week.

Phase 2 will build upon the content for each stream with a technical project, and summer placements will be either in Software Development or Data Science. As such, we recommend that you follow one stream only in order to manage your time effectively and build your knowledge and skills within one stream as much as you can in order to stand out to employers.

### Programming Languages

- [ ] [Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/beginner-python/) is an incredibly useful scripting language used widely in the data science community, but is also useful for creating small pieces of supportive code
- [ ] [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/csharp-first-steps/) is a programming language created by Microsoft and is used in a wide range of industry applications from front-end web applications to back-end APIs. Often combined with [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/dotnet/what-is-dotnet) which is an open source developer platform, created by Microsoft, for building many different types of applications.

### Web Development

- [ ] [HTML & CSS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/build-simple-website/) are the backbone of any web-page. Knowing what these are and how they are structured is fundamental for doing any web development work.
- [ ] [JavaScript](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/web-development-101/) is the fundamental language for running code on the browser. This is what is leveraged (usually) to create rich and seamless user interfaces and experiences on the web.
- [ ] [TypeScript](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/build-javascript-applications-typescript/) is an open-source language by Microsoft which builds upon the original syntax of JavaScript. It provides features such as static type definitions, classes and interfaces which makes it easier for developers to resolve issues, as your application becomes larger. **NOTE** - **ONLY THE FIRST 4 MODULES ARE ESPECIALLY USEFUL** - The remaining content is more advanced, and is unlikely to come up in our use-case for TS starting out. If you feel like you need additional knowledge, go ahead and finish this learning path - we're not going to stop you :smile:
- [ ] [React](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/react/) is a highly versatile view engine used to combine HTML, CSS and JS into one cohesive block (known as _components_). This makes web development much more streamlined and efficient when making changes to the UI. **NOTE** - **IGNORE THIS [PAGE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/react-states-events/4-events)**

### APIs

- [ ] [RESTful APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/build-web-api-minimal-api/) are an implementation of API for accessing information and providing a service without needing to implement a UI. These are useful as they allow developers to perform operations that are quite complex without developing the solution themselves, thus saving time.

### Databases

- [ ] [Relational Databases](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/explore-relational-data-offerings/) are a way to represent stored data. This can be used in combination with an API to create, read, update or delete entries in the database. For example, if you have a website where users are prompted to sign up with user credentials, that user's sign up information will likely be stored using a Relational Database.

### AI/Machine Learning

- [ ] [AI and Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/get-started-with-artificial-intelligence-on-azure/) are complex topics, and are hard to wrap your head around without a lot of pre-requisite knowledge. To help dip your toes in, we've linked in a module for helping explain the basics at a high-level.

## Recommended Schedule :books:

That's a LOT of modules - and we're sure that a lot of you are probably feeling quite overwhelmed right now (we definitely were when we did this).

To help you out, we've created a schedule which will allow you to complete all of the recommended modules and also meet the requirements to pass Phase 1!

We have also created small modular workshops for each section of MS Learn. **These workshops intended for you to solidify your understanding and are optional. To pass Phase 1 all you will have to do is obtain 34,000 MS learn XP on your account.**
